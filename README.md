# Leaflet-Map-Prototype
A responsive map prototype using Bootstrap and Leaflet.js to add user interactivity (popups, markers, filtering portions of the map etc.)

### Category
Data visualisation/interactive maps

### Purpose
Prototype that showcases UK's bilateral relations with EU's member states.

### User needs
Developed as a prototype after a Foreign Affairs Committee request to have complimentary material for one of their reports. The map works as a simple to use, single page app and allows users to interact with it by clicking on different sections to reveal information, filter out portions of the map, create heatmaps, and make use of additional content (images, videos).

### File structure
Main file `index.html` with all dependencies (css, js, geojson data) in separate folder
```
index.html
|_map_dependencies
```

### Dependencies
Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and the following dependencies
- [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Geojson map data pulled from [GeoJSON Maps of the globe](https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/)
